# Customer Churn on Telco Dataset


Customer churn (or customer attrition) refers to the loss of customers or subscribers for any reason at all. 

Businesses measure and track churn as a percentage of lost customers compared to total number of customers over a given time period. 

This metric is usually tracked monthly and reported at the end of the month.
